    <p><b>Fall 2019:</b> Class Personal Project</p>

    <p>
      <b>Goal:</b> For my photography class, the assignment was to choose 
      a song and take photos to accompany the lyrics. And I decided to do 
      my assignment on Maroon 5's <em>Sunday Morning</em>. <br><br>

      While doing this assignment, I thought it would be interesting to 
      showcase my photos on a website since I was just starting to learn 
      web design and development. 
    </p>

      <b>GitHub:</b> <a href="https://github.com/brianwsyang/photoMidterm" 
                        alt="github link">github.com/maroonFivePhotos</a>
    </p>

      <b>Preview:</b> <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/brianwsyang/photoMidterm/blob/master/photographyMidterm.html"
                         alt = "preview link">preview of the website</a>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p><b>HTML</b></p>
    <p><b>CSS:</b> Flexbox</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>
      <b>Updates:</b> Added a play button that will play the song in the 
      background. The button is interactive so it can pause and play the 
      song.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Next Steps:</b> Something I would like to do in the future with 
      this project would be to recreate the website with ReactJS and add 
      some interactive elements. When I was working on this project, I 
      had only learned HTML and CSS, so I didn't quite know how to build 
      a website with ReactJS.

      One of the interactive elements that I thought about adding was a 
      carousel that would rotate through based on the song that will be 
      playing in the background.
